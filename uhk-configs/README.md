# UHK configs

Customizations for the [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard (UHK)](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/).

Modifications:

- dim backlight keyboard lights
- disable the red leds
- change mouse speed
- RIGHT side `Fn`, `Alt`, `Super`, and `Ctrl` are mapped like vim's HJKL: Arrow left, down, up, right 
    - I never use these keys anyway, and this way I don't need an additional modifier to use arrow
      keys when selecting text.
- `Mouse` is mapped as `Super`
    - Useful in SwayWM...
