# UHK configs

Customizations for the [Ultimate Hacking Keyboard (UHK)](https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/).

Modifications:

- dim backlight keyboard lights
- disable the red leds
- change mouse speed
- RIGHT side `Fn`, `Alt`, `Super`, and `Ctrl` are mapped like vim's HJKL: Arrow left, down, up, right 
  - I never use these keys anyway, and this way I don't need an additional modifier to use arrow
      keys when selecting text.
- `Mouse` is mapped as `Super`
  - Useful in SwayWM...
- LEFT side: Swap left `Alt` and `Fn`
  - `Fn` is easier to reach, but I only use it seldemly (changing the audio level)
  - I need the `Alt` key more often in IDEs (f.ex. Rider, Emacs)
- activate double-tap for mod-key
  - this should reduce the pain during text-selection with ctrl+shift+alt and arrow key movement
