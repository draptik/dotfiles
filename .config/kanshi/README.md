# kanshi

This is the wayland equivalent of `autorandr`.

> kanshi allows you to define output profiles that are automatically enabled and disabled on hotplug. For instance, this can be used to turn a laptop's internal screen off when docked.

The different profiles should be ordered from the most specific to the most generic.
