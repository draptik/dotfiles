# My dotfiles

Currently I have 2 machines running arch linux (laptop and desktop).

All configs are soft-linked manually via `ln -s ...`.

I was recently made aware of the great resource site [dotfiles.github.io/](https://dotfiles.github.io/). Something to keep in mind for future setups. But I'll also keep tools like [`nix`](https://nixos.org/nix/) and [`ansible`](https://www.ansible.com/) in mind...
